# Heartcode CanvasLoader
Heartcode CanvasLoader is a JavaScript UI library, which uses the HTML canvas element to draw and animate circular preloaders.<br/>
The library is currently in beta, some minor changes and improvements might be done to it in the near future.

## Documentation
The latest version of the API documentation can be found in the repository under the `docs` folder.

## Contribution
Contributions are more than welcome. Once you made your changes to your fork please make sure you run the build task using Grunt and make a pull request.

You can also add your website / web app link to the Wiki, so the community can see how others use CanvasLoader.

### Using Grunt
I added a few useful Grunt tasks to the project to automate the documentation genetation and the production file compilation. To use Grunt you will need to install npm

and then run ```$ npm install``` in the project root folder to install all dependencies for the project.

Once done with installing the node modules run ```grunt``` to get your build of the documentation and the canvasloader JavaScript file.

## CanvasLoader Creator
I created a tool that can help with generating and previewing loaders with copy/paste code snippets and instructions: http://heartcode.robertpataki.com/canvasloader
